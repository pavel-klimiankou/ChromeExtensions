## What's the problem

Our FB web cases contain lots of data (stacks, tasks, nav and require history, etc.) which is quite difficult (or impossible) to read. 

## How I want it to be: 
In most cases I need to know: 

1. Software version
2. Browser + platform + version
3. Failed task(s) and/or visual clues which tasks were close to the error
4. Clear navigation history + visual clue where error(s) happened
5. Clear stack and preferrably code extract
6. Other known to be important clues: plugins installed, unknown scripts, network conditions, locale settings
